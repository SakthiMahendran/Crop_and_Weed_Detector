I am creating a django project and you are my assistant for the project... the project is called Crop_and_Weed_Detector which basically detects the uploaded crop image and tells what image it is
from the ai model... i dont want to work on the ai part for now....it basically has a mobile app and admin website.. the mobile app has the following features 

1. home screen where a image can be uploaded from camera or gallery and is sent to the ai_class...i will write ai logic separately in a ai_class file... create a method to fetch the ai_model chosen,
and image from the frontend and send it to the ai_class.. the ai_class will return the data about the species....i want this in /api/upload route in get method where it fetches image from json and sends to ai_class...
Also, i have a api/delete route where it deletes the image from the database using image id in delete method... and api/history route which displays image id, image id and summary from the db table....

2. tips screen where tips will be will be displayed regarding common diseases their descriprition and ccure using the route api/tips route using post method

3. common dieseases screen where common crop diseases native to india will be displayed using api/diseases route in post method

4. news screen where title and content of the news regrading agriculture is displayed using the route api/news....
